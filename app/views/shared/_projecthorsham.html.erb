    <h1>Horsham 'The Oaks'</h1>
    <h4>Contour Golf Ltd Provides Construction Expertise</h4>
    <p>Horsham Leisure worked with Contour Golf to provide the all ‘under one roof’ construction solutions, including the complex management of new soils to the site ie storage, distribution and shaping through to final finishing. Contour managed the use of exiting top soils, striping, storing and re using. Contour understood the need for liaison with statutory bodies including the local authority, environment agency and the many ecology issues associated with such an extensive ‘green’ area.</p>
    <h4>The Project</h4>
    <p>Horsham Leisure completed the construction of ‘the oaks’ and ‘firs’ course using imported inert soils over the period 2010-13 the project included construction of 27 holes. The oaks course being an 18 hole layout (6111 yds) incorporating 5 different length courses ie 5 tee positions, extensive approach and run off areas around greens and full specification USGA putting surfaces with full irrigation system to all tees, greens and approaches. The firs and short game area is a 9 hole par 3 course over 959 yds with synthetic tees and lower spec but irrigated greens plus two full specification chipping/pitching greens and associated facilities. In addition across the 160 acre site we have drained all playing surfaces and built 3 new lakes.</p>
