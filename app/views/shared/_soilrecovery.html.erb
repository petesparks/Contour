        <h1>Soil Recovery - Inert Soil Infill Construction</h1>
        <h2>How It Works</h2><h4></h4>
          <p>Utilising recovered soil (often called landfill or inert infill) is a proven method of enhancing your golf facilities by providing fill material to create new shape and interest for a golf course. This can allow for improved drainage with the ability to create swales moving water away from playing surfaces.

          Accepting recovered soil on to a site can also generate revenue to self-fund the improvement process.</p>
