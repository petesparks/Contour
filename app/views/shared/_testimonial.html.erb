                <h4>I am proud to say that I have employed the services of Contour Golf for over 20 years, they have renovated, redesigned, sculptured, reconstructed, drained, enhanced and in some cases help maintain all of the courses I have owned and operated.

                  <h4>"The main issue with the 11th (signature) hole was the green surface which had slopes as severe as 1:4 in places. The whole front section was severely sloped and four-putting was a common problem for players in the summer. The Club was considering making the green a two tier surface but Sparks and Myers convinced them the better solution was to lift the green was and reshape it raising the lowest area by 0.8 of a metre (just under 3 feet). A compatible rootzone was sourced and the original turf, having been stored, was reinstated, this helped to speed up the recovery time and the hole was back in play by the following spring. The bunker on the left of the green was rebuilt some 10 metres closer to the green to tighten the left hand approach and the front bunker was raised in height by over a metre to match the new green height and make it more visible from the tee.  The large right hand bunker was removed and two smaller ones built in its place."</h4>

This in itself is different to what other companies can offer." Explained Eichler who continued, "When we look at a job it is with the eye of professional engineers and dedicated golfers. If you allow us to show you our previous work this will become apparent." No matter what your golf course construction need, Contour Golf really ought to be your first call; first class attention to detail is priceless."</h4>
